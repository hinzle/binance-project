    "Imports used can be found in `imports.py`. (Please ensure libraries are installed for package support).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, I obtained btcusd trading pair data by querying the Binance REST API hosted at <https://api.binance.us/api/v3/klines>. \n",
    "\n",
    "I cleaned and prepped the data by:\n",
    "  - preparing column labels.\n",
    "  - setting `'close_time'` as `datetime`.\n",
    "  - setting `'close_time'` as index.\n",
    "  - spliting dataset into train, validate, and test.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "  I conducted an initial exploration of the data by examing relationships between each of the features and treated close price as a target. Next, I explored further using premier tools such as Pandas, Python, Statsmodels, etc..., to answer the initial questions posed above. Data exploration continues by delving into the descriptive statistics of the dataset. Further investigation includes up / down -sampling, frequency analysis, lag response, and autocorrelation. I found the frequency analysis revealed potential price indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Predictive Model Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "  I used data from 2022 April 26 from approximately 03:30 - 20:30 to determine if the candlestick close price, in conjuncture with the time index, could be used to determine future close prices, then modeled what the predicted values would like against the acutal values. I offer several models that attempt to predict the future price of btcusd trading pair. I used a last observed value (lov), average, 15 minute simple moving average from TAlib, and a basic Holt's linear trend. Root mean square errors (RMSE) are reported for comparison.\n"
